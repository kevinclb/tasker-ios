# tasker-ios
A repository for Tasker: the task marketplace. Built in Swift.
Please ignore the Development Evirnoment as it is beginner code we wrote in swiftUI to display and test connection to the database,
The folder with the name "tasker" is the one that has the code with the new connection to the same database using UIKit
